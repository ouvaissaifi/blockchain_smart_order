# blockchain_smart_order

Beach T-Shirts company designs and sells T-Shirts at outlets across the country.
They work with Threads Inc, a garment factory to get the T-shirts stitched.
Help write a smart contract that allows Beach T-Shirts to create a new order with x qty of T-Shirts. Threads Inc should be able to accept the order. They should then be able to indicate order complete & communicate cost.
Once the order is done & cost has been communicated , Beach T-Shirts should be able to confirm that payment is done (assume actual payment is done outside of the smart contract).
Note: The same Ethereum account should not be able to act on behalf of both entities
